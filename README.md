### About Simply Perfect

Simply Perfect is a lifestyle brand that was founded in 2018. Since the brand is fairly new, there are a lot of changes taking place simultaneously. Despite this, certain aspects of the brand have already been defined, and the Simply Perfect website is the **perfect** outlet to connect with the brand’s intended audience—women between the ages of 30 and 55.
 
Currently, the Simply Perfect website serves as a means for the Simply Perfect founder, Ebony Bell, to connect with the brand’s audience. The website provides **simple** tips and articles about well-being, beauty, and family.
 
The Simply Perfect website will eventually expand and become a fully functioning blog. But for now, let’s keep it **simple**!
